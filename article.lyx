 Differences in the conductance between zero cooling and field cooling were
 measured, and may result from trapped vortices.
 We also measured zero bias peak in the conductance during two of the

\begin_layout Abstract
In this work we also refined methods of device creation using dry transfer.
 During the creation of the device, some dirt and organic material accumulates
 between the layers.
 This dirt decreases the effective contact area, and disturbs tunnelling.
 Heat anhiling is used for removing such dirt.
 We found that using certain parameters of heat anhiling had harmed exposed

The goal of this experiment was to compare vortices behaviour in 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{NbSe}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in different conditions: thin (2-3nm), thick (10-20nm), near the edge or
 at the heart of the sample.
 These conditions may affect the vortex behaviour: penetration of thiner
 layer of superconductor is easier, so more vortices are expected.
 At the heart of the sample, vortices are less likely to enter, or leave
 once enterred.
 In order to characterize vortices behaiour, we built a device of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{NbSe}_{2}$
\end_inset

 coverred by Tungstan Deselenide (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{WSe}_{2}$

 by vortices).

\begin_layout Subsection
superconductivity, vortices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
superconductivity is a phenomena where the material is a perfect conductor
 (zero resistance) and a perfect diamagnet (repels magnetic field).
 The diamagnetism is achieved by edge currents that keep 
\begin_inset Formula $B=0$
\end_inset

 inside the superconductor.
 This state takes place in very cold metals (for example: lead 
\begin_inset Formula $7K$
\end_inset

, aluminium 
\begin_inset Formula $4K).$
\end_inset

 This state is removed by a sufficiantly strong external field H.
 In Type I superconductors become normal at a spesific 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{c}$
\end_inset

, and type II superconductors change gradually: superfonducting under 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{c1}$
\end_inset

, normal over 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{c2}$
\end_inset

, intermediate state between.
 At predicted in Ginzburg Landau theory, the magnetic flux 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 penetrates the material quantized.
 Since the magnetic energy is 
\begin_inset Formula $E\propto B^{2}$
\end_inset

, the stable state is where the flux is quantised at single units: those
 are single flux units penetrating the material, serrounded by super current
 that protects the rest of the material from the magnetic field.
 The field 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 drops exponentially 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim exp(-\lambda x$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the penetration depth.
 at the Heart of the vortice, there is a normal state core.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In previous work done in the lab
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
unpublished results
\end_layout

\end_inset

 it was shown that the width of the super conductor affect the behaviour
 of vortices.
 From Ginzburg-Landau theory of super conductors it is derived that material
 with finite width, has an effective penetration depth 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{eff}$
\end_inset

 which rises as the width decreases.

\begin_layout Subsection
density of states in superonductor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
BSC model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BCS is a model for superconductivity.
 It suggests that a minor attractive electron electron interaction creates
 energy states lower then 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{f}$
\end_inset

, and that these states entangles the two electron in 
\begin_inset Formula $|\vec{k}\uparrow,-\vec{k}\downarrow>$
\end_inset

 state.
 It's not trivial, as generally in 3D not every potential well has bound
 states.
 Also, the coloumb repulsion between the electrons is screened by the positive
 ions of the crystal.
 The suggested source of attractive interaction is mediated by the ions
 (and is in some sense 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

over screening
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

): an electron that passes by attracts the ions, and creates a wake of high
 density of positive charge, which can be viewed as a phonon.
 Another electron passing by is attracted to these ions, and therfore is
 attracted to the first electron.
 The key point is that the electrons are moving much faster then the ions,
 and thus the coloumb repulsion can be efectively screened

Considering two electrons with attractive interaction 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\vec{r_{1}}-\vec{r_{2})}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{f}$
\end_inset

 on top of inert fermi sea.
 In the frame of reference of the center of mass, and assuming for simplicity
 that the interaction potential has interaction only for momenta which has
 energy close to 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{f}$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $V_{k,k^{'}}=-V_{0}\cdot\begin{cases}
\begin{array}{cc}
\xi_{k,}\xi_{k^{'}}<\hbar\omega_{c} & 1\\
else & 0
\end{array}\end{cases}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
wheras 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{k}=\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m},\xi_{k}=\epsilon_{k}-E_{f},\omega_{c}=\omega$
\end_inset

 debye: the maximal frequency of the phonons in the crystal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is 
\begin_inset Formula $E=2\cdot E_{f}-\Delta,\Delta=2\hbar\omega_{c}\exp(-\frac{2}{g(E_{f})\cdot V_{0}})$
\end_inset

 .
 So the pair of electrons with attractive interaction, has energy state
 that is lower than 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{f}$
\end_inset

.
 To minimize the energy, the electrons need to be not far, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\vec{r}=\vec{r_{1}}-\vec{r}_{2})$
\end_inset

 should be symetric, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi(S_{1},S_{2})$
\end_inset

 would be anti-symetric (singlet) so the entire wavefunction would be anti-symet
ric.

\begin_layout Subsection
tunnelling into superconductor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electrons can tunnel only to an uncoupied energy state.
 If no final state with the electron's energy exists, tunnelling is supressed.
 Therefore, tunnelling current of electrons with energies within the gap
 is diminished.
 It is important to note that the temperature influences the tunnelling:
 at finite temperature the fermi dirac distribution of electrons energies
 has finite width.
 An electron may get some additional energy from the electrons bath of the
 superonductor and land on a state ouside the gap.
 Impurities in the SC influence the density of states, as around them there
 is normal material, with a different density of states (that influence
 is still not fully understood).
 One instance of such impurities are the current vortices around flux that
 penetrated the superonductor.

 The device was built on a silicon chip using dry-transfer technique: Thin
 layers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{NbSe}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{WSe}_{2}$
\end_inset

 were peelled from bulk material with cello-tape.
 Later, they were piled one above the other.
 Gold electrodes (the normal material) were evaporated using e-beam lithography
 technique.
 One of the junctions was above the edge of the SC material, the other was
 above the heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We intended creating two separate NIS junctions.
 However, heat anhiling that had been applied on the sample affected the
 exposed 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{NbSe}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the contacts laid on it didn't work, what left the double junction.
 An elaboration on the technique and conclusions from the heat anhiling
 are at the appendix.

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R=0.1[M\Omega],C=1\mu F,\tau=0.1[sec]$

\begin_inset Formula $\sim0.5[sec]$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $5.0[sec]$
\end_inset

 whichever worked better), voltmeter that measures the current, computer,
 BNC wires, USB and GPIB cables that connect some of the instruments to
 the computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the comunication between the computer and instrument was established using
 MeasApp application.
 The current value was avaraged (by MeasApp).
 Usually avaraging 40 samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the voltmeter that measures current from the output of the amplifier avarages
 on mode medium (slow was too slow, fast too noisy)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
notes on procedures:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to a drift of the DAC, the measured 
\begin_inset Formula $V=0$
\end_inset

 deivated sometimes from real 
\begin_inset Formula $V=0$
\end_inset

.
 This is sure since different measurements have 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{min}$
\end_inset

 that minimises 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 at different voltages.
 Also, without applied voltage there should be no tunelling current (
\begin_inset Formula $I(V=0)=0$
\end_inset

).
 However, the minimal current measured was above 0, probably due to imperfect
 ground connection issues (that leaks to the device through the metallic
 pipes and cooler).
 In order to optimize the effect, we found V where I was minimal, and then
 thouched some of the metal wires and pipes connected to the cooler and
 sample.
 These random touches changed I, and we stopped when I was minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During all measurements, the voltmeter that measures the current was checked
 real time, to make sure that it stabilises on a constant value (except
 noise).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The temperature creates a thermal spread in the energy (
\begin_inset Formula $1K\to80\mu V)$

 The width is

\end_inset

 compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $2[mV]$
\end_inset

 measured at single junctions.
 The width of the gap is wider, probably due to the fact this is a double
 junction.
 A simple model is this: each junction recieves only a part of the bias
 voltage, and as long as any of them carries a voltage in it's gap, it's
 conductance is almost zero.
 Thus, the conductance of the pair rises only in voltage that is high enough
 to take both junctions out of their gap.

Discussion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conductance rises with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 without threshould, indicating that vortices enter the sample even at the
 lowest field (at both junctions).
 The curve when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is decreasing has staircase behaviour, which could be attributed to flux
 penetrating in descrete portions.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 of the stairs are at 
\begin_inset Formula $0.011,0.043,0.061,0.082,0.102,0.119[T]$
\end_inset

, with deltas of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.032,0.018,0.02,0.02,0.017[T]$
\end_inset

 .
 So except the first step which is wider, all the steps have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H\approx0.02[T]$
\end_inset

.
 However, it's not in the flux quantum 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 since when 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is increasing the stairs don't apear.
 These results suggest that the vortices leave the sample at bigger groups
 then they enter.

This experiment has suggested that in field cooling vortices are trapped
 inside the material.
 We also tried some measurements that checked time dependancy of the vortices
 in zero cooling (time dependancy was not observed).
 In future work, we intend checking time dependance in field cooling, and
 also to compare junctions at the heart of the sample with junctions at
 the edge of sample.

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The he features including zero bias peak were not expected, and we don't
 have a simple explanation.
 We could not reproduce them, but they don't behave as random noise: they
 occured smoothly on a 2D scan, both with 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 scanned upwards on downward, with very similar results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One possible reason is a current surge stemming from quick chnage of the
 bias voltage from 60 to 0 mV (due to a setup problem).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A possible source to these features could be a special state of vortices
 trapped within the junction near the heart of the sample.

 This is important in order to know for sure the device structure, and in

The contacts laid over exposed

 Possible reason for this failure: observing optical images of device before

 the color of exposed 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{NbSe}_{2}$
\end_inset

 changed, which indicates a possible change in the texture of the material
 surface.
 Perhaps that change disturbes the contact with the electrode.
 Also, the crack that existed in the material expanded.

 This also suggests a possible technique: cover

 with mono-layer graphene, which is strong and can serve as protector.
 The superconductivity will be induced to the graphene by proximity.

As mentioned earlier, the oven temperature controller has overshot.
 It is possible that without this overshooting the

 would survive.
 It is therefore required to control the temperature better and avoid overshooti
ng.

Finally, the heat anhiling in this procedure didn't remove most of the dirt.
 Perhaps a higher temperature would clean it, if the

 is protected (by graphene as metioned earlier).

Final device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the AFM measurements, golden electrodes were laid on the chip using
 e-beam technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The chip contained 4 devices, and 32 electrodes.
 In contact testing, it has turned out that only 2 electrodes were connected
 through a device (one of the four devices).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
eventually, there was a single device with 2 contacts laid over the insulator

, which created a device of structure NISIN.

\begin_layout Standard
In some of the conductance 
\begin_inset Formula $G(V)$

 and zero bias conductance

\end_inset

.
 It can stem from small area that can be either charged or uncharged, and
 influences the conductance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As control measurement, we took measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $I(V\sim0,H=0,t)$
\end_inset

 from which 
\begin_inset Formula $G(t)$
\end_inset

 was estimated similarly to zero bias conductance.
 One of the measurements doesn't present an easy pattern.
 Another one has two modes, changing every other measurement point.
 This alternation suggests that maybe it stems from the electronic measurement
 apparatus.
 It seems unprobable that there is phenomenon with rate of exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $1[Hz]$
\end_inset

 which is the sampling rate.
 Future control measurements will include measurements in different sampling
 rates to examine the source of the bistability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far: there is bistability, but we are not sure about it's source, and
 the interleaved measurement is strong evidence it is connected to the electroni
c measurement apparatus.
